# :books: TUTORING SCHOOL SYSTEM
___

This is  a project i built for learning purposes, it uses **FastApi** to create a  tutoring school backend
system integrated with [Google Calendar API](https://developers.google.com/calendar/api/guides/overview).

Main idea is to create a ERP system to make it easier to manage tutoring school needs.
Api is built on FastApi with Pydantic models for json serialization, async Sqlalchemy orm for database interaction,

and Docker for easy deployment.

## :book: User guide:

### Get ready:
- First go to your [Google Calendar page ](https://calendar.google.com/)
- Create new calendar, and copy calendar ID
- in .env.example you have fields for configuring CALENDAR_ID and TIME_ZONE
- delete .example part so you are left with .env file containing your data
- You need to create a [Google Cloud project](https://developers.google.com/calendar/api/quickstart/python) 
   ,enable Calendar API and get OAuth credentials
> Copy your OAuth json file contents to creds.json, remove .example extension
>>Code will automatically create token.json in same folder to store session token

### :rocket: Run with Docker:
- Api is dockerized with docker-compose, one command runs the Api server, Postgres server and PgAdmin
- Make sure to have Docker installed, if on Windows use [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- Navigate to your project directory and run command

```bash
docker compose up
```

- Verify the compose containers running with: 
```bash
docker ps
```

- **Thats it!**
- **School System Api** is available on **localhost:8000**, **PgAdmin** is available on **localhost:8080** 
- **Postgres Database** is externally available on **localhost:5433**, while for containers use **db:5432**

>For running without docker, you can set .env USE_LOCAL_DB=True, which will instead use local sqlite database
>> Use uvicorn api.server:app --reload for running without Docker
